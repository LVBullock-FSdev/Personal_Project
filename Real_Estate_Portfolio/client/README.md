Pet Shelter - 9/18/2021

In this belt exam you will create a pet shelter where users can put up pets for adoption, and adopt pets.

For a red belt:
Dashboard: Display all of the pets currently available to be adopted
Users can add pets to be put up for adoption (user can create pets)
A pet details page exists that displays information about that pet
Users can update the information about a pet
Users can adopt the pet which will remove it from the database
Validations
Pet name, pet type, and pet description are all required and must be 3 characters or longer
Pets may have between 0 and 3 skills
For a black belt:
Deployed on Amazon EC2
And 2 of the following:

Socket.io - when a pet is adopted, remove it from the table for all users viewing the dashboard
Sort the pets in the shelter by type
Include a button to like a pet, disable it when clicked until the component reloads
Apply validations when updating
Ensure the pet name is unique when adding it to the database

General Guidelines
Do everything the prompts ask for. Ask your instructor if you are not sure.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
